# Project-4-NBA-Draft-Machine-Learning
## Intro to the project
Our goal for this project was to find a dataset and create a model using machine learning to get an accuracy score of over 80. We chose a dataset that had college basketball stats and info and whether or not they were drafted. We decided to try and create the best model we could to predict if someone was going to get drafted or not.
